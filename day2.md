Day 2:

Finished up the JS Conditionals lesson. Also worked on the Logical Operators and Functions lessons, including their labs!

The highlight of my day, was being able to help out a codepanion that was stuck on a Validation/Authentication error on her Rails project.

Joined a Rails Form Helpers study group, led by one of my favorites instructors at Flatiron, Jonathan Foster. I love his lectures, there isn't a time where I dont learn something new. Today: Procs!

Finished up the day by twitting my progress: https://twitter.com/wendisha/status/1124135345963065344
