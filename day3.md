Day 3:

I decided to switch to Flatiron's new curriculum's version, which has updated content in the Git & GitHub, HTML and CSS sections. It pushes me back by 5%, but everybody tells me it's worth it! So I went back to finish up the Git & GitHub lessons today.

I also learn about ways to test and debug in Javascript.

Finished up the day by twitting my progress: https://twitter.com/wendisha/status/1124488878746931201
