Day 4:

Today was a bit slow, but I still managed to put in over an hour's worth of code learning by reading about scoping in Javascript.

I also joined a cool study group that made me feel part of The Flintstones since I did not have any VSCode extensions, other than Ruby 0.22.3, which provides debugging support, but now I have a whole list of useful plugins to try out!

Finished up the day by twitting my progress: https://twitter.com/wendisha/status/1124866614011289600
