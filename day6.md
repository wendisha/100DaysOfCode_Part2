Day 6:

Decided to go back to some HTML and CSS new lessons from the new v7 curriculum. Great refresher!

Had fun helping out a codepanion decide his model associations for his Rails Porfolio project. Shared some resources on the gems I used for my project, and talked a little about how I accomplished my project idea, more specifically how I had to reinvent it to meet the project requirements. My Rails project is one of my dearest!

Also, more JS scoping! :)

Finished up the day by twitting my progress: https://twitter.com/wendisha/status/1125581542074593285
