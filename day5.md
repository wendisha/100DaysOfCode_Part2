Day 5:

Sunday Funday! It's usually a bit hard to put in some coding time on a sunday, taking into consideration family duties, but I managed to study for over an hour learning to debug the most common errors in JavaScript.

I also read more about JS scoping.

Finished up the day by twitting my progress: https://twitter.com/wendisha/status/1125235031977410560
