#Day 1:

Started off by tackling a few lessons from Javascript Basics:
    * Best use of Comparison Operators:
        * Strict equality and inequality operators being preferred over loose equality/inequality operators.
        * When using Relational Operators, stick to comparing numerical values.
    * What is Control Flow.
    * Refresher on expressions.
    * Whats a block statement in JS.
    * Truthy and Falsy values in JS.
    * Conditional Statements:
        * If...else (to be continued tomorrow...)

Joined a 3rd part of a creating a Rails App for Portfolio Project purposes study group, led by Jennifer Hansen, where we worked on displaying error messages and implementing OAuth Facebook strategy.

Had a insightful conversation with my code buddy Mohammad Adeel about the weird behavior of my OAuth for Facebook implementation on my Virtual Blood Bank app, where I can log into Facebook using the rails server, instead of thin.

Joined a Interview Practice Prep session, where I got to work on a fairly easy challenge to get me back on track.
